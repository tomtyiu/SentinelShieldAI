# README.md

## Overview

This repository contains a Python program designed to load, chunk, and index content from a specified blog post to create a retriever, and then incorporate that retriever into a question-answering chain. The code utilizes various components from the LangChain library and OpenAI's GPT-4 model to achieve this functionality.

## Features

- **Content Loading and Chunking**: Loads the content from a blog post, chunks it into manageable pieces, and indexes it for retrieval.
- **Question-Answering Chain**: Incorporates the retriever into a question-answering chain to provide concise and accurate answers.
- **Moderation and Guardrails**: Implements a moderation system to ensure that the input questions are allowed and adhere to ethical and legal standards.
- **Interactive Mode**: Provides an interactive mode where users can input questions and receive answers based on the retrieved content.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API Key or Groq API key
- Required Python libraries (see below)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
    cd repository
    ```

2. **Install the required Python libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install langchain
    pip install openai
    pip install bs4
    pip install chromadb
    pip install langchain-community
    ```

3. **Set the OpenAI API Key**:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    export GROQ_API_KEY =  "you-api-key"
    ```

## Usage

1. **Load and Index Content**:
    The program loads content from the specified blog post, chunks it, and indexes it using the following components:
    - `WebBaseLoader`
    - `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`
    - `Chroma`
    - `OpenAIEmbeddings`

2. **Question-Answering Chain**:
    The program incorporates the retriever into a question-answering chain using `ChatPromptTemplate` and `ChatOpenAI`.

3. **Moderation and Guardrails**:
    The `LLM_guard` function ensures that the input questions are allowed and adhere to ethical and legal standards.

4. **Interactive Mode**:
    The program runs in an interactive mode where users can input questions and receive answers based on the retrieved content.

    ```python
    # Run the program
    python main.py
    ```

    Users can input questions in the format `GPt4o-mini (Default:What is Task Decomposition?, Exit: type exit) >>`. To exit the program, type `exit`.
